/*
Design and implement a University Course Registration System in C++ using Object-Oriented
Programming Concepts. The system should allow students to be added, courses to be created, and
student registrations to courses to be managed. It must prevent duplicate course registrations and
enforce limits on the number of students and enrollments.

- Add new student with first and last name, DOB in MM-DD-YYYY format and unique student ID
- Add a new course with a unique course code, title and instructor name
- Register a student to a course by student ID and course code
- The program should list all students (amx 10) and all courses (max 5) based on the menu option
- Use Input validation for date format and numeric entries
