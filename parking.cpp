/*
Design and implement a simple command-line Parking Lot Management System in C++ to
register cars entering a parking lot, track their information, and persist the data to a file for
future use.

Your code should be able to:
  - Add a new car
  - Remove a car by license plate
  - Search a car by license plate
  - View all currently parked cars
  - Quit the application

Car's information has: License plate: 6 alphanumeric characters; First/last name: letters only;
                       Permit ID: 1 letter + 8 digits (total 9 characters); Time: valid 24-hour time (HH:MM)

  Data is saved in a file named parking_data.txt

  See PDF for sample input/output
